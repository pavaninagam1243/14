    <p>The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus[a] are smartphones designed, developed, and marketed by Apple Inc. They are the sixteenth generation of iPhones, succeeding the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini, and were announced at the Apple Event in Apple Park in Cupertino, California on September 7, 2022, alongside the higher-priced iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max flagships. The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus feature a 6.1-inch (15 cm) and 6.7-inch (17 cm) display, improvements to the rear-facing camera, and satellite connectivity. The iPhone 14 was made available on September 16, 2022 and iPhone 14 Plus was made available on October 7, 2022 respectively, and was launched with iOS 16.[4] Pre-orders for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus began on September 9, 2022.[7]

        The iPhone 14 Plus replaces the iPhone 13 Mini in Apple’s lineup. It is the first iPhone to bring back the "Plus" moniker since the iPhone 8 Plus in 2017. iPhone 14 and 14 Plus models (as well as iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max models) sold in the United States drop support for physical SIM cards, making them the first iPhone models since the CDMA variant of the iPhone 4 to not come with a discrete SIM card reader.[8]</p>
